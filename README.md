# MinecraftUpdater
This is a python package to automate the updating of your Minecraft server.<br>
It's very annoying to have to download the jar,
ftp it over, stop the server, back up your world, etc. This automates alll that. just git clone this in the root of
your server so there is an extra folder. Then run python3 update.py in the new folder. It will check if you have the
latest version of Minecraft using the Mojang provided manfest URL. If your server is out of date, it will download the latest minecraft server jar from the official Mojang S3 bucket. Then using screen it will announce to the server that it is going to restart for an update, and give a 5 minute countdown before stopping the server. ~~Next it will then backup your world into a new folder, incase something goes wrong.~~ I recommend using nicolaschan's minecraft backup script to backup your server. It then updates the server jar and starts the server (using aikar's flags! yay!) back up in a ~~screen~~ tmux session named "minecraft-server" so it's in the background.
